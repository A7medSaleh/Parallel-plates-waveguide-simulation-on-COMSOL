A waveguide is a structure that guides waves, such as electromagnetic waves or sound, with minimal loss of energy by restricting expansion to one dimension or two.

In this model I make an accurate modeling for a parallel plate waveguide on Comsol to study its behavior and see the different modes. The solution is for infinite parallel plates by applyibg periodic boundary conditions.
